We are handling information of the students in the 2022M cohorts, we are storing their email addresses. You are required to store the email addresses in an array of 10 students in low level programming. 
- You are required to store the details (email), using the dynamic memory management functions
- You are required to use malloc() or calloc() and the compulsory use of free().

Without the need to change the existing data in the specified array, you are considering the array to shrink down to 6 students. You will be adding the required tricks to shrink the dynamic memory management.
